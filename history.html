                    First of all, a little history and why it has become a tradition at all.

                    The organization of such event includes many nuances, 
                    so many people spend time either with their family 
                    or let themselves go with the flow.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    For me, the organization was not always easy, 
                    but I always enjoyed it in spite of 
                    the money, time and effort spent.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    This tradition does not last so long, but I made the decision to keep it.

                        On average, preparation always took a week, 
                        but this is taking into account the fact 
                        that the whole plan is already ready 
                        and all that remains is to implement it.

                    There were always a couple of friends 
                    who helped with everything. 
                    Shopping for groceries sometimes turned out to be 
                    the most difficult task, 
                    but it was easier and more fun 
                    thanks to those friends.

                    When that day comes, 
                    my head always stops working

                    of what was prepared.

                        Then the time comes 
                        when all the people gather in one place, 
                        which turns into complete nonsense: 
                        someone does not know where and how to get there, 
                        someone asks a bunch of stupid questions, 
                        and then some kind of individual remains, 
                        which everyone else is waiting for.
